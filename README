The only caveat with this release is that the application doesn't do sanity checking on the
saved window frame when you start up. This means that when you launch S/Key and move it
to the lower-left corner of your 1280x1024 screen and close it, then change resolution to 640x480
and start up S/Key again, you won't have the application on the screen.

You can work around this by opening up Workspaces and swapping desktops. When you go back
to the one you launched S/Key in, the tab will be visible allowing you to move the window. Note
that this will save the location you move the window to even when you switch back to 640x480.

I know it's ugly, but I don't know any good way of getting around it.
